# basic-discord-bot
A nice discord bot in progress to practice working with various libraries and environments in python. 
Eventually I hope to write a functioning music bot with commands personalized for a private server used by some of my friends and I.

Since I've been using JavaScript more frequently as of late, at some point before the Fall ends I'm going to
reimplement this bot using the discord.js module - I will create a new repository for that implementation as well.

Take care!
